The franchisee pays fees and royalties in exchange for training, support, and the use of proven business methods."},{question:"How much money do I need to start franchising my business?",answer:"Initial costs typically range from $100,000 to $500,000, including legal fees ($15,000-$40,000), FDD preparation, operations manual development, training systems, and working capital. The exact amount depends on your business complexity and expansion goals."},{question:"How long does it take to franchise a business?",answer:"The franchising process typically takes 6-12 months from start to launch. This includes business assessment (30-60 days), legal documentation (60-90 days), operations manual creation (60-90 days), and pilot testing (30-60 days)."}]},{category:"Requirements",icon:"📋",questions:[{question:"What makes a business franchisable?",answer:"A franchisable business needs: proven profitability for 12+ months, systemized operations that can be replicated, strong unit economics, distinctive brand or competitive advantage, and scalable business model that doesn't rely on the owner's personal relationships."},{question:"Do I need multiple locations before franchising?",answer:"While not legally required, having 2-3 successful locations demonstrates your business model's replicability and provides valuable operational insights. Most successful franchisors start with proven multi-unit experience."},{question:"What legal requirements must I meet?",answer:"You must comply with the FTC Franchise Rule, which requires providing a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) to prospective franchisees at least 14 days before signing. Additionally, 14 states require franchise registration before selling franchises."}]},{category:"Financial Aspects",icon:"💰",questions:[{question:"How do franchise royalties work?",answer:"Franchisees typically pay 4-8% of gross revenue as ongoing royalties, plus 1-3% for marketing funds. These payments provide sustainable revenue for the franchisor and fund ongoing support, training, and system improvements."},{question:"What should I charge for franchise fees?",answer:"Initial franchise fees typically range from $25,000 to $75,000, depending on industry, brand strength, and support provided. The fee should reflect the value of your brand, training, and ongoing support system."},{question:"How much can I expect to earn as a franchisor?",answer:"Franchisor revenue comes from initial fees and ongoing royalties. A system with 50 franchisees paying 6% royalties on $500,000 annual revenue each would generate $1.5M annually. However, you must factor in ongoing support costs."}]},{category:"Operations",icon:"⚙️",questions:[{question:"What support must I provide to franchisees?",answer:"Franchisors must provide initial training, ongoing support, marketing assistance, operational guidance, quality control, and system updates.

You'll need systems to monitor and address compliance issues."},{question:"Can I terminate a franchise agreement?",answer:"Yes, franchise agreements include termination clauses for specific breaches such as non-payment, brand violations, or failure to meet standards.

Licensing typically grants use of intellectual property with minimal ongoing involvement. Franchising is more regulated and requires FDD disclosure."},{question:"How do I find qualified franchisees?",answer:"Qualified franchisees are found through franchise brokers, trade shows, online portals, and targeted marketing. Look for candidates with adequate capital, relevant experience, commitment to your system, and alignment with your brand values."},{question:"What happens if my franchisee fails?",answer:"Franchise agreements should address failure scenarios, including territory rights reversion, asset purchase options, and non-compete enforcement. Support struggling franchisees when possible, but be prepared to protect your brand through proper legal channels."},{question:"Can I franchise internationally?",answer:"Yes, but international franchising involves additional complexity including foreign laws, currency considerations, cultural adaptation, and often requires master franchise or area development agreements. Start domestically to prove your model first."},{question:"How often must I update my FDD?",answer:"The FDD must be updated annually, with material changes requiring amendments within 90 days. Regular updates ensure compliance and provide current information to prospective franchisees about your system's performance and changes."},{question:"What insurance do I need as a franchisor?",answer:"Franchisors typically need general liability, professional liability, cyber liability, and errors & omissions insurance. Your attorney and insurance agent can recommend specific coverage based on your industry and business model."},{question:"How do I handle franchisee disputes?",answer:"Most franchise agreements include dispute resolution procedures starting with direct negotiation, followed by mediation, and finally arbitration. Maintain clear documentation, follow contract procedures, and involve legal counsel when necessary."},{question:"Can I buy back franchise locations?",answer:"Franchise agreements may include buyback provisions under certain circumstances. However, these must be clearly defined in the original agreement and comply with franchise laws. Buybacks require fair valuation and proper documentation."},{question:"What ongoing training must I provide?",answer:"Ongoing training requirements vary by industry but typically include new employee training, refresher courses, new product/service training, and management development.
