## Implementation Notes

**Progressive Development Path:**
1. Start Shetland/Pinto players with Drills 1-4 to build foundation
2. Introduce Pinto/Mustang players to Drills 5-10 for intermediate skills
3. Challenge Bronco/Pony players with Drills 11-20 for advanced techniques
4. Push Colt+ players with Drills 21-25 for elite performance

**Practice Structure Recommendations:**
- Warm-up with mechanics drills (5-10 minutes)
- Main work with 2-3 drills matching skill level (30-40 minutes)
- Finish with competitive/situational drills (15-20 minutes)
- Cool down with soft toss or visualization

**Equipment Priorities:**
- Essential: Tees, balls, bats, screens
- Recommended: Multiple tees, colored balls, heavy bats, video equipment
- Optional: Launch angle tools, measurement devices, training aids

**Safety Reminders:**
- Always use screens for tossers
- Maintain safe distances between stations
- Check equipment for damage before use
- Proper warm-up prevents injuries
- Supervise all drills with young players
