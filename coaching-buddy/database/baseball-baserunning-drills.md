**Coaching Points:**
- Aggressive secondary lead is essential for first-to-third success
- If ball is hit in front of runner, always be aggressive
- If outfielder doesn't move or moves one step, runner likely stays at second
- Runner's eyes should find ball, then third base coach

**Instructions:**
1. Set up pitcher, catcher, and middle infielders
2. Runner takes normal lead from first base
3. As catcher receives pitch, runner reads catcher's body language and middle infield positioning

8. Track success rate and discuss when delayed steal is appropriate
9. Progress to delayed steal from third to home on wild pitch or passed ball

**Coaching Points:**
- This steal succeeds due to defensive mistakes, not pure speed

- Catcher awareness is key - if catcher stands up and looks at runner, abort
- Higher success rate than straight steal because defense is relaxed

**Skills Taught:**

- Eyes on catcher receiving pitch - any bobble or ball in dirt, evaluate scoring
- Walking lead provides momentum toward home while keeping balance
- With two outs and ground ball contact, runner sprints home immediately
- Never get picked off third base - it's unacceptable mental mistake

**Coaching Points:**
- Headfirst slides are faster returning to base, not necessarily advancing
- Hands extended with palms down, fingers up

## DRILL 23: Speed Development Circuit

**Divisions:** Mustang (9-10), Bronco (11-12), Pony (13-14), Colt (15-16), Palomino (17-18), Thorobred (19-23)

**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced

**Duration:** 20 minutes

**Min Players:** 2

**Equipment:** Bases, cones, stopwatch, resistance bands (optional)

**Description:** Dedicated speed and acceleration training focused on improving raw baserunning speed through proper running mechanics and explosive power.

**Instructions:**
1. Warm up with dynamic stretching: leg swings, high knees, butt kicks
2. Station 1: 60-foot sprints from home to first (5 repetitions)
3. Station 2: 90-foot sprints from first to second (5 repetitions)
4. Station 3: 180-foot sprints around bases from home to second (3 repetitions)
5. Station 4: Resistance band sprints if available (10 repetitions of 30 feet)
6. Focus on proper sprint mechanics: knee drive, arm pump, forward lean
7. Rest 1:1 ratio (run 10 seconds, rest 10 seconds)
8. Time each player's fastest 60-foot and 90-foot times
9. Track improvement week to week

**Coaching Points:**
- Proper running form increases speed more than just "running harder"
- Drive knees forward and up, not out to sides
- Arms pump from shoulder, not from elbow
- Stay on balls of feet, not flat-footed
- Forward body lean (slight) increases acceleration
- Speed training should be done when fresh, not fatigued

**Skills Taught:**
- maximizing-speed
- aggressive-running
- run-through-first
- steal-execution

## DRILL 24: Two-Base Advancement Mandate

**Divisions:** Bronco (11-12), Pony (13-14), Colt (15-16), Palomino (17-18)

**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Duration:** 25 minutes

**Min Players:** 6

**Equipment:** Bases, balls, gloves, full outfield

**Description:** Practice drill mandating all runners advance two bases on every outfield single, developing aggressive mentality and quick decision-making.

**Instructions:**
1. Set up live hitting or coach-pitched scenarios with full defense
2. Announce rule: "Every single to outfield, runner goes two bases"
3. Runner at first must reach third; runner at second must score
4. This removes hesitation and forces aggressive secondary leads
5. Defense tries to throw out aggressive runners
6. Track outcomes: safe at third/home, out attempting third/home
7. After 15 reps, analyze: which ball locations allowed successful two-base advancement?
8. Discuss why delayed reads result in one-base advancement
9. Return to normal baserunning with new aggressive mindset

**Coaching Points:**
- This drill builds aggressive mentality that transfers to games
- Runners learn what's possible with proper secondary leads
- Forces runners to read ball quickly and commit to decision
- Some outs are acceptable when learning aggression
- Coaches learn which runners have speed for aggressive plays
- Translate drill success to game situations

**Skills Taught:**
- aggressive-running
- first-to-third
- scoring-second
- secondary-leads
- advanced-reads

## DRILL 25: Championship Baserunning Relay

**Divisions:** All divisions (adjust complexity by age)

**Difficulty:** Beginner to Advanced (scaled by division)

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Min Players:** 8

**Equipment:** Bases, balls, gloves, cones

**Description:** Team relay race incorporating multiple baserunning skills appropriate for each age group, creating competitive fun while reinforcing techniques.

**Instructions:**
1. Divide team into two equal groups by speed and skill
2. Each team lines up at home plate
3. **Shetland/Pinto:** Run all bases, touch each one, return home
4. **Mustang:** Run through first, round first to second, slide into second, run home
5. **Bronco/Pony:** Take lead from first, steal second, round second to third, slide into third, score home
6. **Colt+:** Simulated game scenario with random coach calls (tag up, steal, first-to-third, etc.)
7. First player completes circuit, tags next teammate
8. Continue until all players complete their turn
9. Winning team must demonstrate all techniques correctly (speed + technique = winner)

**Coaching Points:**
- Make it competitive but emphasize proper technique over pure speed
- Celebrate good form, not just winning team
- Have teams cheer for their runners
- Correct major errors but keep energy high
- Scale difficulty to match age group capabilities
- This drill reviews all skills learned in practice

**Skills Taught:**
- **Shetland:** base-locations, running-direction, touching-bases
- **Pinto:** run-through-first, banana-turn, sliding-intro
- **Mustang:** leadoffs, stealing-basics, sliding-technique, rounding-bases
- **Bronco:** steal-execution, secondary-leads, pop-up-slide
- **Pony+:** aggressive-running, elite-baserunning-iq, advanced-reads, all advanced skills

## Implementation Notes for Coaches

### Practice Planning
- **Shetland/Pinto:** 10-15 minutes of baserunning per practice, focus on fundamentals
- **Mustang/Bronco:** 15-20 minutes per practice, introduce competitive elements
- **Pony and above:** 20-25 minutes per practice, emphasize game situations

### Progression Strategy
1. Master fundamentals before advancing to complex drills
2. Younger divisions should repeat basic drills frequently
3. Older divisions benefit from live situational drills
4. Always connect drills to actual game situations

### Safety Considerations
- Always wet grass or use sliding mats for sliding practice
- Check local league rules on headfirst sliding
- Ensure proper warm-up before speed/stealing drills
- Monitor younger players for fatigue during longer drills
- Use proper protective equipment (especially catchers during steal drills)

### Assessment and Improvement
- Time players regularly on 60-foot and 90-foot sprints
- Track stolen base success rates in practice
- Video analysis helps players see their own form
- Create baserunning goals for each player
- Recognize improvement, not just natural ability
