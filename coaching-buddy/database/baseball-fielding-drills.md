**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced

**Duration:** 25 minutes

**Min Players:** 10

4. Defense must communicate coverage, cutoffs, and backup responsibilities
5. Progress to complex scenarios: bases loaded, bunt situations
6. Rotate offensive and defensive players every 5 minutes
7. Keep score based on defensive execution (not runs allowed)
8. Final round: championship situation, tie game, extra innings

**Coaching Points:**
- Communication must be constant and loud before every pitch
- Everyone has a job on every play - no spectators
- Think two plays ahead: what if ball gets through?

3. Players practice diving motion without ball to learn proper form
4. Progress to slow rolls requiring one step and dive
5. Emphasize landing on chest/stomach, not shoulder
6. Add game-speed element: balls requiring full sprint and dive
