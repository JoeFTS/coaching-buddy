## Safety and Arm Care Guidelines

### Critical Rules for Young Pitchers:

1. **Pitch Counts** (per game):
   - Ages 7-8: 50 pitches maximum
   - Ages 9-10: 75 pitches maximum
   - Ages 11-12: 85 pitches maximum
   - Ages 13-14: 95 pitches maximum
   - Ages 15-16: 95 pitches maximum
   - Ages 17-18: 105 pitches maximum

2. **Rest Requirements**:
   - 1-20 pitches: No required rest
   - 21-35 pitches: 1 day rest
   - 36-50 pitches: 2 days rest
   - 51-65 pitches: 3 days rest
   - 66+: 4 days rest

3. **Breaking Balls Age Guidelines**:
   - No curveballs before age 12
   - Limited curveballs ages 12-14 (max 10-15 per outing)
   - Focus on changeup as primary off-speed pitch

4. **Warning Signs of Overuse**:
   - Decreased velocity
   - Changes in mechanics
   - Arm pain during or after throwing
   - Loss of command
   - Fatigue earlier in outings

5. **Year-Round Recommendations**:
   - Take at least 3-4 months off from competitive pitching
   - No throwing through pain ever
   - Limit to pitching on one team at a time
   - Focus on overall athleticism, not just baseball
